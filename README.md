# AI-project
We've chosen to do a version of the text analyser project, where we focus on categorizing either the content of the text or the type of text, depending on the difficulty level of the two.

Suggested tools so far are:
Python >= 3.0
TextBlob, https://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/dev/
NLTK, http://www.nltk.org
