================
Team members:
-------------
   * Sarah Berenji
   * Andreas Forstén
   * Hannes Leskelä
   * Josefine Letzner

Project goal:
-------------
To implement a text analyser that, although on a basic level, correctly analyses and cathegorizes text.a
The lowest grade that we will aim for is C, but due to limited time and resouces we won't aim for an A from the start. If the project work load is easier than expected, then the target grade might change to a higer one.
For information regarding the requirements for each grade, please see this page: [project topics](https://www.kth.se/social/course/DD2380/subgroup/ht-2015-ai15/page/topics-4/)

Tools:
------
We are going to use Python >= 3.0 to write the text analyser.
Tools will be added as the project goes along.
