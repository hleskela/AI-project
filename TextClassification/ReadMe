The NLTK_NBC folder contains a first test of the NLTK Naive Bayes classifier. This was abandonded due to the slowness of
NLTK, and instead replace with SciKit (SK). It can be ignored.

 
The SK_MNB folder contains the SK_MNB.py file, together with train and test data. This was used to perform all the tests made.
You can change the test data as you want, but we recommend that you do not change the train data, as BlockSpring can have some 
trouble retrieving much data from Wikipedia. The data will then contain information that is not supposed to be added to it,
which has to be manually removed. Therefore you should not use the createTrainingData method. The same is true of
the version below with a user interface, where the user previously had the choice to create new training data. We removed
this option to prevent the user from creating unwanted errors.

 
The SK_MNB_with_UI folder contains the file SK_MNB_with_UI.py. This can be run as it is, all the necessary training data is available. 
This is useful if one wants to test some specific articles, as the article names are not hard coded as they are in the SK_MNB.py file.
NOTE: Articles chosen are not allowed to be disambiguous on Wikipedia, as BlockSpring can not handle them.
